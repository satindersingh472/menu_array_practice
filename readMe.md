This is a menu_array_practice project

3. The Menu
3.1. Create a variable called menu_items (array of strings)
3.2. Fill the array with 10 strings that are valid external image 
sources
3.3. Create a section in your HTML with a unique id
3.4. Create a button in your HTML with a unique id
3.5. Write JS code that will achieve the following:
3.5.1. Go through the event listening steps to react to the button 
being clicked
3.5.2. When the button is clicked, the event function will insert a 
new img tag onto the page getting the src from the array made 
earlier.
3.5.3. After the images are added, the button should be deleted from 
the page
3.6. Modify the array to now be an array of objects with the following 
key-value pairs:
3.6.1. title (string)
3.6.1. image_source (string)
3.6.1. price (number)
3.7 Modify the event function to now insert a div tag that contains an 
img tag, an h2 tag for the title and a p tag for the price
